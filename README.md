# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# Animations in the Project

This project features modern CSS animations that enhance the user interface and improve interactivity. Key animations and their purposes include:

## Hover Effects

- Buttons and navigation icons have hover animations to provide visual feedback to users.
- These effects include subtle background color changes and smooth transitions.

## Dynamic Button Animation

- The button utilizes a scaling background animation powered by the `@keyframes` rule.
- The `hoverEffect` animation creates a dynamic scaling effect, adding an engaging and polished appearance.

## Responsive Behavior

- Animations adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring consistent visual appeal across devices.

## Keyframe Animations

- Smooth transitions and animated scaling effects are implemented using `@keyframes`, enhancing the overall aesthetic.

## Focus and Active States

- Interactive elements like input fields and buttons include animations for focused and active states, improving accessibility and user experience.

These animations are crafted to create a visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.
